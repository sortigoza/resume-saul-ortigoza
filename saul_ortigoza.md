## Accomplishments

As an **SRE Engineering Manager**, I've consistently provided valuable and timely feedback to all Engineers, helping them align their career growth with the Discipline and company goals. Over a span of 2+ years, this has resulted in:
- A high-performing team where everyone is either a mentor or a mentee.
- Five plus promotions approved by a committee.
- Five plus projects with long recurring renovations.
- 70% team participation in Hiring initiatives.
- More than 65% of the team certified in AWS, GCP, Terraform, k8s.
- Five SRE community champions.

For a FinTech customer, the data-platform we created significantly improved the data team's capabilities, scalability, performance, and compliance. The platform transformed from a brittle, manual, and GUI-based flow to a fully compliant CI/CD process, enabling swift changes in infrastructure, data models, and DAGs. The time spent on new database integrations reduced from 3+ days per table to integrating a whole schema in just 1 hour.

Other key initiatives for the FinTech customer included:
- Redefining the AWS permissions strategy and implementing an Okta-AWS permissions and authentication system, making the entire company's AWS authentication more efficient.
- Refactoring data-intensive and ML microservices to enable extensibility.
- Discovering and implementing a no-code/low-code solution aimed at improving the experience and efficiency of the operation teams.
- Contributing to the migration of a monolith to Kubernetes and defining a strategy to manage Kubernetes manifests with Jsonnet.

## Continued Learning

In the past year, I've expanded my technical knowledge in several areas:

- **Clojure:** To expose myself to different programming perspectives and practice functional programming. I've read the book "Clojure Applied."
- **Snowflake, DBT, DVC, SageMaker:** I familiarized myself with these technologies to better understand and provide recommendations to the data team.
- **GraphQL:** Acquired practical knowledge and application.
- **Software Design:** Read "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler, "Software Design Decoded", and "Engineering Software Products" for a refresher.

In leadership and management, I've read and applied principles from several books:

- "Radical Candor" by Kim Scott
- "The Score Takes Care of Itself" by Bill Walsh
- "Principles" by Ray Dalio
- "Infonomics" by Douglas B. Laney
