## Additional Notes: Results

As an SRE Engineering Manager, I always provided valuable and prompt feedback to all the Engineers, understood and help them grow in their career and align them with the Discipline and company goals, resulting in a timespan of 1.5 years: a high performing team, where everyone has a mentor or a mentee, 5 promotions (approved by a committee), 5 projects with long recurring renovations, 70% of the team participation in Hiring initiatives, more than 65% of the team certified in either AWS, GCP, Terraform, k8s, and 5 SRE community champions.

The data-platform created for the FinTech customer improved the data team capabilities (CDC, parallel-compute, site-to-site VPN tunnels, schema-on-read, SFTP-to-S3), scalability, performance, and compliance. It went from a brittle, manual, and GUI-based flow to a fully compliant CI/CD process to introduce changes, to the infrastructure, data models, and DAGs. New database integrations improved from spending 3+days per table to be able to integrate a whole schema in 1 hour.



Other important initiatives for the FinTech customer included:

- Defining the AWS permissions strategy and implementing an Okta-AWS permissions and authentication system impacting how the whole company authenticated to AWS resulting in a more efficient approval and permissions assignment process (less than a day from weeks), and auditable file of all roles and permissions, a generators and configuration strategy to manager permissions complexity and enable composability.
- Refactoring some of the data-intensive and ML microservices to enable extensibility, some of these services were migrated from Scala and JavaScript to python to leverage the team skills. The refactored services have a 90%+ coverage, capability for A/B testing, observable, documented, and ETLed.
- Smaller initiatives included the discovery and PoC of a no-code/low-code solution in track to improve the experience and efficiency of the operation teams. Automated CD pipelines for the legacy infrastructure as code. Helped in the migration of a monolith to Kubernetes. Defined a strategy and automation to manage kubernetes manifests with Jsonnet, resulting in DRY and extensible configurations. Provided valuable input for the kops to EKS migration.

## Additional Notes: Learning

On the technical side, some of the things I have learned in the last year are:

- Clojure, to be exposed to different programming perspectives and practice functional programming. Read the book Clojure Applied.
- Snowflake, DBT, DVC, SageMaker I needed to get familiar with some of these technologies to have a better understanding and provide a better recommendation to the data team. I participated in a hackathon where we used DVC to demonstrate how can we ensure model reproducibility, compliance, and do an ML pipeline.
- GraphQL
- Currently reading Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler
- Also read: Software Design Decoded, Engineering Software Products for a refresher

On the leadership and management side, read and applied some books:

- Radical Candor by Kim Scott
- The Score Takes Care of Itself by Bill Walsh
- Principles by Ray Dalio
- Infonomics by Douglas B. Laney
